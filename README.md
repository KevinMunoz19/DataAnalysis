# Data Analysis

Data analysis of a automobile data set obtained from URL, by examining correlation between various variables like horspower, engine size, highway mpg and price of automobiles; descriptive statistical analysis of variables like number of doors, engine location and number of cylinders; grouped data analysis (drive wheels and body type correlation with price) with heat maps; Pearson correlation between price and wheel base, horsepower and other variables; and ANOVA statistical method.

Data analysis of the given data set leads to this conclusions: 
1. Engine size and price have a positive direct correlation (0.8723), indicating engine size is a potential predictor for the price of an automobile. 2. Highway mpg and price have a negative direct correlation (-0.704). 3. Rpm and price present a lot of variability and a weak correlation (-0.1016), indicating rpm might not be a good predictor of the price. 4. Engine location would not be a good predictor variable for price since there is only three cars with rear engine and 198 with front engine. 5. Pearson correlation between 8 variables and price indicates that every one of them have a p-value < 0.001, which indicates that the correlation is statistically significant, but taking into account the linear relationship, the curb weight and horsepower present a strong linear relationship (0.834 and 0.809 respectively).
